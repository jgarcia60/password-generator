# Password-Generator

## Description 

This project practices array manipulation and iterations in JavaScript. The goal is to create a random password based on the types of inputs given by the user, including the use of special characters, numbers, and lower case letters. 

The code utlitizes while loops to keep prompting the user for inputs until the inputs from the user are "acceptable". The the code establishes the appropriate lengths to index each array. The Math.random() function is used to generate a random index within the bounds defined by the user, and then this process is iterated over the desired length of the password.
